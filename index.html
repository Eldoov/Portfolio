<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<p>This is my portfolio of all websites/web pages/web apps I build. Eventually, there will be an intro page. For now, let's keep everything simple.
</p>

<h2><a href="Web101">Web101</a></h2>

<p>Filled with many static single pages. Just for practice.</p>



<h2><a href="WebApp">WebApp</a></h2>

<p>Some personal projects for fun and practice.</p>



<h2><a href="Sites">Sites</a></h2>

<p>Full websites with different functions that can be used as a portfolio in CiacconaStudio.</p>
